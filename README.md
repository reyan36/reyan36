# Hi, I’m Reyan 👋

I’m a computer science student.

I like building small projects that solve problems I face in my daily life.  
It helps me stay close to computers and makes learning more fun.

I enjoy going to hackathons and working with people from different places.  
Sharing ideas, building together, and giving my best effort is something I really like.

I also write articles on various topics and really enjoy participating in competitive programming competitions.
